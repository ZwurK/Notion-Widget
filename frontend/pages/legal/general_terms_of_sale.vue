    <section class="mb-4">
      <p class="mb-2">
        Since June 1, 2023, a free electronic means for consumers to cancel
        their subscription contracts must be provided. This obligation applies
        even if the initial contract was not concluded electronically.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-2">
        This functionality should be directly and easily accessible from your
        website (or mobile application) where contracts are concluded.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-4">
      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Mandatory Information</h2>
      <p class="mb-2">
        The functionality should be presented under the label "cancel your
        contract" or a similar unambiguous phrase in readable characters.
        Additionally, it should provide clear and understandable information
        about the cancellation terms (e.g., notice period, cancellation fees,
        consequences of cancellation, etc.).
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-4">
      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Consumer Identification</h2>
      <p class="mb-2">
        The functionality should allow the consumer to provide or confirm the

      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-2">
        <li>
          Consumer's first and last name, or if a contract was concluded with a

        </li>
        <li>
          Email address or, if not available, postal address to confirm receipt
          of the cancellation notification
        </li>
        <li>
          Any reference previously communicated to the contract holder to
          identify the holder and the concerned contract (e.g., a customer or
          contract number)
        </li>
        <li>
          Desired cancellation date, subject to legal or contractual provisions
        </li>

          the line or lines affected by the cancellation
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mb-2">

    <section class="mb-4">
      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Notification of Cancellation</h2>
      <p class="mb-2">
        The consumer should be able to notify you of the contract cancellation
        through a function directly accessible from the summary page of their
        information. This function should be presented with the label
        "notification of cancellation" or a similar unambiguous phrase in
        readable characters.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-2">
